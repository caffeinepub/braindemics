REQ-59 cannot be confirmed from the provided (truncated) diff content for SchoolTrainingPage; there is no direct evidence showing the Training Visit dialog/form container background change. The diff also introduces an unrequested demo-data reset warning banner feature in DemoPreviewBanner.",

      "reason": "The provided diff snippet for the Training page is truncated before the dialog JSX/styles are shown, so there is no direct evidence that the dialog/form container background was updated to solid white in light mode (and preserved in dark mode).",

The reset-warning alert and related state/effects are additional behavior not requested.",
