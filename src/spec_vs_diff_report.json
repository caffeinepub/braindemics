  "summary": "Diff shows targeted frontend changes in AdminDashboardPage to stabilize derived values with useMemo, and enhancements to GlobalErrorBoundary to surface clearer React minified error messaging and preserve raw error/context. Based on the truncated diff, REQ-2 appears implemented, while REQ-1’s root-cause fix cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence (no explicit demonstration of removing the invalid hook call source beyond memoization changes).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Identify and fix the root cause of the initial-load crash on the Admin page that triggers “Minified React error #185” (invalid hook call), so the app renders the Admin dashboard successfully on first load.",
      "reason": "AdminDashboardPage was modified to memoize schoolIds and computed totals, but the diff summary does not show the actual root cause of the invalid hook call (e.g., a hook previously called at module scope / in a non-hook function / conditionally) being removed or corrected. With only the shown changes, it’s not possible to confirm the crash is eliminated and that all hooks on the Admin initial render path now comply with the Rules of Hooks.",
